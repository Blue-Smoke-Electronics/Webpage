	<h1>A Portable "Benshtop" Powersupply</h1>
		<p> blue Smoke Electronics is proud to present a new type of powersuplly. The (P)ortable (B)enchtop (P)owersupply (PBP) is a small size battery driven powersupply with all the fearues you normaly expect in a traditional benchtop powersupply. </p>
		
		<h2>Do I need a Benchtop powersupply?</h2>
		<p> A benchtop powersuply is used by engieers and sientists when they are working with lov voltage DC electricity. There is two features that make a bencthop powersupply so very usefull and that is ajustabel voltage, and ajustable current limit. </p>
			<h3>As a voltage source </h3>
			<p> ajustable output voltage means that a powersupply can be used as voltage source, witch is a part of almost all electronic circuits. It also mean that you can use it in place of a battery of any type. </p>
			<h3>As a current source </h3>
			<p> when the current limit is applyed the powersupply act as a current source. while not as comon as voltage sources, thay are used in large number of elecotonic ciruits. One example of a current source is needed is when lighting up a LED. </p>
			<h3>Protection</h3>
			<p> When testing out new circuits it is comon parctise to set the current limit just abouv the current you are expecting the circuti to draw. That way, if somthing is wrong, the chance of somtihng bing damage by large currents is reduced. </p>
			
		<h2>Why portable?</h2>
		<p> Tradisional benchtop powersupplyes are, as the name sugestes, designed to be stationary at your workbench. For most projects this is fine, but for some project you have to take out a extention cord and a trolly and bring your powersupply out into the feald.
			To make this process easyere, Blue Smoke electronics has desigend portable vertion. No need to bring a extention cord, and the powersuply fitts in your pocket.</p>
			<h3> Out doors projects</h3>
			<p> reapearing somting that is atatched to youre car? Not alowed to fly drones indoors? Homemade firework displays? Some projects is just not a good idea to do indoors, and with a PBP it you can just power them up outside. </p>
			<h3> Take it home form work</h3>
			<p> Some times we just have to work on weekends, and wouldn't it be better to have youre prototype settup on youre livingroom table instead of you going all the way back to the lab just to thest out the new firmware path?</p>
			<h3>Around the house</h3>
			<p>If you are setting up a servo that automaticly opens a window when it gets to hot, then you can hid a pbp behind a curtion until you can get permanent wiering to the window. </p>
			<h3>At the factory flor</h3>
			<p>If you replac the larg benctop powersupply in your test station with a PBP, that makes room for... </p>
			<h3>On the train</h3>
			<p>Have a long comut, the PBP is perfect for portable lab suitecases</p>
			<h3>Store it in a drawr</h3>
			<p> Do you not have a place that is dedicated to electronics? Do youre kids? If this is more of a hobby to you, chouse a powersupply that is easy to stove away when not in use. </p>
