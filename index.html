	<h1>A Portable "Benshtop" Powersupply</h1>
		<p> blue Smoke Electronics is proud to present a new type of powersuplly. The (P)ortable (B)enchtop (P)owersupply (PBP) is a small size battery driven powersupply with all the fearues you normaly expect in a traditional benchtop powersupply. </p>
		
		<h2>Do I need a Benchtop powersupply?</h2>
		<p> A benchtop powersuply is used by engieers and sientists when they are working with lov voltage DC electricity. There is two features that make a bencthop powersupply so very usefull and that is ajustabel voltage, and ajustable current limit. </p>
			<h3>As a voltage source </h3>
			<p> ajustable output voltage means that a powersupply can be used as voltage source, witch is a part of almost all electronic circuits. It also mean that you can use it in place of a battery of any type. </p>
			<h3>As a current source </h3>
			<p> when the current limit is applyed the powersupply act as a current source. while not as comon as voltage sources, thay are used in large number of elecotonic ciruits. One example of a current source is needed is when lighting up a LED. </p>
			<h3>Protection</h3>
			<p> When testing out new circuits it is comon parctise to set the current limit just abouv the current you are expecting the circuti to draw. That way, if somthing is wrong, the chance of somtihng bing damage by large currents is reduced. </p>
			
		<h2>Why portable?</h2>
		<p> Tradisional benchtop powersupplyes are, as the name sugestes, designed to be stationary at your workbench. For most projects this is fine, but for some project you have to take out a extention cord and a trolly and bring your powersupply out into the feald.
			To make this process easyere, Blue Smoke electronics has desigend portable vertion. No need to bring a extention cord, and the powersuply fitts in your pocket.</p>
			<h3> Out doors projects</h3>
			<p> reapearing somting that is atatched to youre car? Not alowed to fly drones indoors? Homemade firework displays? Some projects is just not a good idea to do indoors, and with a PBP it you can just power them up outside. </p>
			<h3> Take it home form work</h3>
			<p> Some times we just have to work on weekends, and wouldn't it be better to have youre prototype settup on youre livingroom table instead of you going all the way back to the lab just to thest out the new firmware path?</p>
			<h3>Around the house</h3>
			<p>If you are setting up a servo that automaticly opens a window when it gets to hot, then you can hid a pbp behind a curtion until you can get permanent wiering to the window. </p>
			<h3>At the factory flor</h3>
			<p>If you replac the larg benctop powersupply in your test station with a PBP, that makes room for... </p>
			<h3>On the train</h3>
			<p>Have a long comut, the PBP is perfect for portable lab suitecases</p>
			<h3>Store it in a drawr</h3>
			<p> Do you not have a place that is dedicated to electronics? Do youre kids? If this is more of a hobby to you, chouse a powersupply that is easy to stove away when not in use. </p>
		
		<h2>Other benefits of a battery</h2>
		<p>Not needing to be connected whith a cable all the time is not the only benefit of having having a battery internaly in the device. </p>
			<h3>Energy buffer</h3>
				<p>The battery acts a buffer, alowing a constant low current input and high current output burtst. This allows device to be powered from any USB port and deliver power indefenetly to a device that requiers more
				powerdraw than USB can provide if the powerdraw is not continus. Servo motors are grate examples of devices that require a lot of power when moving, but most of the time do not require any power alowing the battery to charge back up. </p>
			<h3>True isolation from the grid</h3>
				<p>For some RF sensitive mesurements, you do realy want to be soure that there is no noice copeled from the powergrid into youre electronics. One realy good way to make sure no signal is coming from the grid is to disconnect from the grid. Not fysicaly bing connected also eliminates the posibility of ground loops. </p>
			<h3>No risk of electrocution </h3> 
				<p>There is nowhere in the device that the voltage levels are more than a fiew volts higher that the output voltage. This makes it imposible to get a dangures electric shock, eaven if you do somting realy stupid like taking it with you for a swim. Do not use a powersupply connected to 230V when testing equipnent in the baththube. </p>
		
		<h2> The specs </h2>
		<p> A compleat list of spesifications can be found <a href="https://github.com/Blue-Smoke-Electronics/PBP/wiki/Features">here</a> the most important ones is: </p>

		  <li>current form 0-1A </li>
		  <li>9.2Wh battery life</li>
		  <li>charging via usb-c </li>
		  <li>Controlable via usb-serial interface</li>
		  <li>size: 120x70x25mm </li>
		  <li>weight: 300g</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h2> Where can i get one? </h2> 
		<p> The PBP is stil under devleopment and is not for sale yet. If you are intrested, send an email to simen@bluesmoekeelectronics.no and i will send you back an email when devices is ready for sale. If everyting goes as planed, the first units will be available for sale by the end of this year. 
			Updates on the development will be posted at <a href="https://github.com/Blue-Smoke-Electronics/PBP/wiki/Development-log">this blogg</a> </p>
		
		<h2> Build it youreself </h2>
			<p> If you are skilled with a soldering iron, own a 3d printer and like sourcing electronic components you are free to try to built the PBP for youre self. All the drawings and schematics is freely avilable at <a href="https://github.com/Blue-Smoke-Electronics/PBP/">github</a>. Let me know if you find any improvments to the design or the documentation while building. </p>
		
	<h1>Blue Smoke Electronics</h1>
	<p>Blue Smoke Electronics is a small single persion company located at an small istland in northern norway. By leading development of open source projects like the PBP blue smoke electronics is hoping to improve both the local socity and the world wide socity of electronics engineers. </p>
		<h2>Donaitions </h2> 
		I am hoping that in time sales of the pbp will generate enoght revenue to keep the buisnis going, but smale donations will meen that i can focus more of my time on none revenue generating activities like writing tutorials and imporving the opensource documentation. If you have the means to help, and want to see more from Blue smoke Electronics in the future, 
		an email to simen@bluesmokeelectronics.no.
